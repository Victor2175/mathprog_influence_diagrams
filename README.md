# Integer programming on the junction tree polytope for influence diagrams

Implementation of mathematical programming approaches introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07039.pdf.

The implementation of the mixed-integer linear programs for POMDP and chessgame are available here. 

The notebook mathprog_POMDP.ipynb shows how to solve a POMDP with some randomly drawn parameters.
The notebook mathprog_chessgame.ipynb shows how to solve a chessgame with some randomly drawn parameters.
